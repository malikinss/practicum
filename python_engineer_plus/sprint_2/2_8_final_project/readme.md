# Lesson 2.8: Final Project — Budget and Calorie Tracker 💸🥗

## Description 📝

This lesson is the final project, where I develop a **Budget and Calorie Tracker**, a Python application featuring two calculators: **CashCalculator** for tracking financial expenses with currency support (RUB, USD, EUR) and **CaloriesCalculator** for monitoring calorie intake. Both inherit from a base **Calculator** class, ensuring modularity and maintainability.

This lesson includes a project brief with technical specifications, 1 programming practical task, and no theoretical explanation or questions, focusing on practical application.

## Purpose 🎯

By the end of this lesson, I will:  
✅ Build a modular budget and calorie tracking system using OOP  
✅ Implement inheritance and polymorphism for efficient code reuse  
✅ Handle date parsing, currency conversion, and formatted outputs  
✅ Deliver a project meeting PEP 8 and technical requirements

## Concepts & Theory 🔍

### 🔹 Project Context

-   **Scenario**: Develop a Python application for tracking expenses and calorie intake.
-   **Requirements**: Implement `Calculator`, `Record`, `CashCalculator`, and `CaloriesCalculator` classes, with functionality for record management, daily/weekly stats, currency conversion, and motivational messages.
-   **Skills Applied**: OOP (inheritance, polymorphism), datetime handling, string formatting, input validation, testing with `pytest`, optional Type Hints.

### 🔹 Key Components

-   **Calculator**: Base class managing records and stats (today/week).
-   **Record**: Stores amount, date, and comment for each entry.
-   **CaloriesCalculator**: Tracks remaining daily calories with status messages.
-   **CashCalculator**: Manages expenses in RUB, USD, EUR, including debt tracking.

## Practical Task 🧪

### 1️⃣ **Budget and Calorie Tracker**

The lesson includes 1 practical task implementing the project:

1. **`Money and Calorie Calculator` (2_8_1_money_calorie_calculator)**: OOP-based tracking system.
    - Implements `Calculator`, `Record`, `CashCalculator`, and `CaloriesCalculator`.
    - Supports expense/calorie tracking, currency conversion, and formatted outputs.
    - Ensures modularity, maintainability, and PEP 8 compliance, with optional Type Hints.
    - Tested with `pytest` and validated with `flake8`.

💡 This task integrates OOP, datetime, and testing in a real-world tracking application.

## Benefits ✅

-   Practical application reinforces OOP and Python proficiency.
-   Inheritance and polymorphism enhance code modularity.
-   Automated testing with `pytest` ensures robust functionality.
-   PEP 8 and optional Type Hints prepare code for professional standards.

## Recommendations 📌

-   Use `datetime` for reliable date parsing and comparisons.
-   Validate inputs in `Record` to handle edge cases.
-   Run `flake8` and `pytest` before submission to ensure compliance.
-   Include Type Hints for better code clarity, even if optional.
-   Commit and push changes regularly to GitHub.

## Output 📜

After completing this lesson, I now:  
✅ Develop a modular budget and calorie tracking system  
✅ Apply OOP principles like inheritance and polymorphism  
✅ Implement currency conversion, date handling, and formatted outputs  
✅ Deliver a project meeting PEP 8 and technical standards

## Conclusion 🚀

Completing the Budget and Calorie Tracker project solidifies my expertise in Python and OOP.  
By building a modular, tested application with professional standards, I’ve demonstrated my ability to tackle real-world programming challenges, preparing me for advanced development tasks. 🧑‍💻✨
