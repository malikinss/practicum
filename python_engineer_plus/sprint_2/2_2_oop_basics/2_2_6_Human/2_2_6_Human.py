TODO:
    Describe the interaction between a student, mentor, code reviewer,
    and curator in OOP.

    All of these people are people, so let's create a base class Human with
    a name property (every person should have a name)
    and an answer_question() method for answering questions.

    By default, the Human object will answer any question like this:
        "Very interesting question! I don't know."

    Let's inherit the Student, Mentor, CodeReviewer, and Curator classes from
    the Human class.

    A student should be able to ask questions.

    Implement the ask_question(Human, question) method in the Student class.

    When called, this method should:
        1. Print the question on the screen in the format:
            <name of the person to whom we are asking the question>,
            <text of the question>
        2. Ask the question to the person, an object of the Human class.
           The name of the object to which the question is addressed is passed
           when calling the ask_question() method.

    Mentor, CodeReviewer, and Curator class objects should be able to answer
    questions when the answer_question() method is called.

    An unexpected question was asked â€” the default answer will do.

    After you finish writing the code, your program should display
    the following text on the screen:
        Marina, I'm feeling sad, what should I do?
        Hold on, everything will work out. Do you want a video with cats?

        Ira, I'm feeling sad, what should I do?
        Take a rest and come back with questions about theory.

        Evgeny, when is the vacation?
        Very interesting question! I don't know.

        Evgeny, what's wrong with my project?
        Oh, a question about a project, that's what I love.

        Vitaly, how can I get a job as a Python engineer?
        Very interesting question! I don't know.

        Ira, how can I get a job as a Python engineer?
        I'll tell you now.
