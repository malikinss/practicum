# Lesson 2.3: Command Line 💻

## Description 📝

This lesson introduces the **command line** (terminal) and its use for managing a computer through text-based commands, focusing on the `bash` shell and basic navigation.

This lesson includes a detailed theoretical explanation, **no practical programming tasks**, and **no theoretical questions**, emphasizing command-line fundamentals.

## Purpose 🎯

By the end of this lesson, I will:  
✅ Understand the role and benefits of the command line  
✅ Navigate the file system using `bash` commands  
✅ Use commands like `pwd`, `ls`, and `cd` effectively  
✅ Leverage `bash` features like autocompletion and command history

## Concepts & Theory 🔍

### 🔹 Command Line

-   **Purpose**: Text-based interface for system management.
-   **Benefits**: Resource-efficient, fast for development, essential for many tools.
-   **History**: Evolved from physical terminals to modern emulators.

### 🔹 Bash Shell

-   **Purpose**: Default shell on macOS/Linux, available via `Git Bash` on Windows.
-   **Interface**: Displays user, computer name, and `$` prompt for commands.

### 🔹 File System Navigation

-   **Structure**: Hierarchical tree with root (`/`) and home (`~/`) directories.
-   **Context**: Commands operate in the current directory.

### 🔹 Key Commands

-   **`pwd`**: Shows current directory path.
-   **`ls`**: Lists directory contents, with options like `-a` (hidden files), `-l` (details).
-   **`cd`**: Changes directories (e.g., `cd Desktop`, `cd ..`, `cd ~/`).

### 🔹 Bash Features

-   **Autocompletion**: `Tab` completes file/folder names.
-   **Command History**: `↑` arrow recalls previous commands.

## Practical Task 🧪

### 1️⃣ **No Practical Tasks**

This lesson focuses on theoretical understanding and hands-on practice with `bash` commands, with no programming tasks. The emphasis is on mastering terminal navigation.

## Benefits ✅

-   Command line proficiency enhances development efficiency.
-   Bash commands enable precise file system navigation.
-   Autocompletion and history reduce errors and save time.
-   Terminal skills are essential for many programming tools.

## Recommendations 📌

-   Always verify your current directory with `pwd`.
-   Use `Tab` for autocompletion to avoid typos.
-   Combine `ls` options (e.g., `ls -al`) for detailed output.
-   Practice navigating to build confidence in the terminal.

## Output 📜

After completing this lesson, I now:  
✅ Understand the command line and its advantages  
✅ Navigate the file system using `pwd`, `ls`, and `cd`  
✅ Use `bash` features like autocompletion and history  
✅ Feel confident managing directories in the terminal

## Conclusion 🚀

Mastering the command line equips me with essential skills for efficient system management.  
By navigating the file system with `bash`, I’m prepared to use terminal-based tools and streamline my development workflow. 🧑‍💻✨
