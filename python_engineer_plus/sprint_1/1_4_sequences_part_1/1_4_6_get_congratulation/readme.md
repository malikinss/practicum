# Fitness Tracker with Congratulation Message Implementation

## Description üìù

The provided code enhances the fitness tracker module by adding a `get_congratulation` function to select an appropriate congratulatory message based on the distance walked.
The `get_stats` function is updated to include this message in the output.
The program converts steps to kilometers, calculates kilocalories burned, determines the congratulation based on distance thresholds, and outputs a formatted string: `Today you walked <distance_in_km> km and spent <number_of_kilocalories> kilocalories. <congratulation>`.
All numeric values are rounded to two decimal places, and f-strings are used for formatting.

## Purpose üéØ

Intended for fitness tracking applications with motivational feedback, user activity analysis, or educational examples of conditional logic, string formatting, and modular design in Python.

## How It Works üîç

-   **convert_to_km Function**:
    -   Takes `steps` (integer).
    -   Uses `STEP_LENGTH_M = 0.65` (meters per step).
    -   Calculates distance: `(steps * 0.65) / 1000` km.
    -   Rounds to two decimal places and returns as a float.
-   **calculate_calories Function**:
    -   Takes `weight` (kg), `height` (cm), `dist` (km), `hours` (hours).
    -   Uses `Decimal` for precision:
        -   Speed: `dist / hours` (km/h).
        -   Minutes: `hours * 60`.
        -   Calories per minute: `0.035 * weight + (speed^2 / height) * 0.029 * weight`.
    -   Multiplies by minutes, rounds to two decimal places, and returns as a float.
-   **get_fitness_data Function**:
    -   Prompts for `steps` (converted to `int`).
    -   Returns tuple `(steps, weight, height, hours)` with fixed:
        -   `weight = 75.0` (kg).
        -   `height = 175.0` (cm).
        -   `hours = 2.0` (hours).
-   **get_congratulation Function**:
    -   Takes `distance` (km, float).
    -   Returns a congratulatory message based on distance:
        -   `>= 6.5` km: `"Excellent result! Goal achieved."`
        -   `>= 3.9` km: `"Not bad! The day was productive."`
        -   `>= 2` km: `"Not enough, but we'll make up for it tomorrow!"`
        -   `< 2` km: `"Lying down is also useful. The main thing is participation, not victory!"`
    -   Uses chained conditionals to check thresholds in descending order.
-   **get_stats Function**:
    -   Takes `distance` (km), `calories` (kilocalories), and `congratulation` (string).
    -   Returns an f-string:
        -   `f"Today you walked {distance:.2f} km and spent {calories:.2f} kilocalories. {congratulation}"`.
    -   Formats `distance` and `calories` to two decimal places (`:.2f`).
-   **Main Code**:
    -   Calls `get_fitness_data()` to get `steps`, `weight`, `height`, `hours`.
    -   Computes `distance` with `convert_to_km(steps)`.
    -   Computes `calories` with `calculate_calories(weight, height, distance, hours)`.
    -   Gets `congratulation` with `get_congratulation(distance)`.
    -   Calls `get_stats(distance, calories, congratulation)` and prints the result.
-   **Behavior**:
    -   Converts steps to kilometers and calculates calories.
    -   Selects a congratulation based on distance.
    -   Outputs a formatted string with distance, calories, and the congratulation.

## Verification ‚úÖ

Implementation satisfies requirements:

-   **Functionality**:
    -   Outputs: `Today you walked <distance> km and spent <calories> kilocalories. <congratulation>`.
    -   Example input: `steps = 16215`.
        -   Distance: `(16215 * 0.65) / 1000 = 10.53975` km ‚Üí `10.54`.
        -   Calories (for `weight=75`, `height=175`, `dist=10.53975`, `hours=2`):
            -   Speed: `10.53975 / 2 = 5.269875` km/h.
            -   Calories per minute:
                -   `0.035 * 75 = 2.625`.
                -   `speed^2 = 5.269875^2 = 27.7715862890625`.
                -   `speed^2 / height = 27.7715862890625 / 175 = 0.15869479250892857`.
                -   `(speed^2 / height) * 0.029 * 75 = 0.15869479250892857 * 0.029 * 75 = 0.34503397406607144`.
                -   Total per minute: `2.625 + 0.34503397406607144 = 2.97003397406607144`.
            -   Minutes: `2 * 60 = 120`.
            -   Total calories: `2.97003397406607144 * 120 = 356.40407688792857`.
            -   Rounded: `356.40`.
        -   Congratulation: `distance = 10.54 >= 6.5` ‚Üí `"Excellent result! Goal achieved."`.
        -   Output: `Today you walked 10.54 km and spent 356.40 kilocalories. Excellent result! Goal achieved.`
    -   Other cases:
        -   `distance = 4.0` (steps ‚âà 6154): `"Not bad! The day was productive."`.
        -   `distance = 2.0` (steps ‚âà 3077): `"Not enough, but we'll make up for it tomorrow!"`.
        -   `distance = 1.0` (steps ‚âà 1538): `"Lying down is also useful. The main thing is participation, not victory!"`.
-   **Format**:
    -   Uses f-strings for exact formatting.
    -   Distance and calories formatted to two decimal places (`:.2f`).
    -   Congratulation appended with a space after kilocalories.
    -   Matches required wording and punctuation.
-   **Congratulation Logic**:
    -   Correctly selects messages based on thresholds: `6.5`, `3.9`, `2.0`.
    -   Handles boundary cases (e.g., `distance = 6.5`, `3.9`, `2.0`) with `>=`.
-   **Precision**:
    -   `convert_to_km` uses float arithmetic, sufficient with rounding.
    -   `calculate_calories` uses `Decimal` for precise arithmetic.
-   **Correctness**:
    -   Step conversion uses `0.65` meters.
    -   Calorie formula is consistent with prior tasks.
    -   Fixed `weight`, `height`, `hours` align with example context.
    -   No validation needed, as inputs are guaranteed valid.
-   **Documentation**: Clear docstrings with type hints.

## Potential Considerations üõ†Ô∏è

-   **Correctness**:
    -   `get_congratulation` uses descending thresholds (`>= 6.5`, `>= 3.9`, `>= 2`) to ensure correct message selection.
    -   `get_stats` formats all components correctly, including space before congratulation.
    -   Rounding in `convert_to_km` and `calculate_calories` ensures consistent output.
    -   Fixed inputs (`weight=75`, `height=175`, `hours=2`) simplify the example.
-   **Performance**:
    -   `convert_to_km`: O(1) for arithmetic.
    -   `calculate_calories`: O(1) for arithmetic.
    -   `get_fitness_data`: O(1) for input.
    -   `get_congratulation`: O(1) for conditionals.
    -   `get_stats`: O(1) for string formatting.
    -   Total: O(1), highly efficient.
-   **Design**:
    -   Type hints clarify signatures.
    -   Modular functions enhance maintainability.
    -   F-strings in `get_stats` are concise and readable.
    -   `STEP_LENGTH_M` constant is clear.
-   **Alternatives**:
    -   Dictionary for congratulations: More complex for ordered thresholds.
    -   String concatenation: Less readable than f-strings.
    -   Inline conditionals in `get_stats`: Less modular than `get_congratulation`.
-   **Extensibility**:
    -   Easily modified to add more thresholds or messages.
    -   Could accept variable `weight`, `height`, `hours`.
    -   Could include additional stats (e.g., steps).
-   **Edge Cases**:
    -   Zero steps: `distance = 0.0`, congratulation = `"Lying down..."`.
    -   Boundary distances (`6.5`, `3.9`, `2.0`): Handled correctly with `>=`.
    -   Large steps: Handled by float arithmetic.
    -   Non-integer steps: Not applicable (`steps` is `int`).

## Usage Example (For Clarity, Not Submission) üì¶

```python
# Simulated example
steps, weight, height, hours = 16215, 75.0, 175.0, 2.0
distance = convert_to_km(steps)  # 10.54
calories = calculate_calories(weight, height, distance, hours)  # 356.40
congratulation = get_congratulation(distance)  # Excellent result! Goal achieved.
print(get_stats(distance, calories, congratulation))
# Output: Today you walked 10.54 km and spent 356.40 kilocalories. Excellent result! Goal achieved.

# Test cases for different distances
def test_stats(steps):
    d = convert_to_km(steps)
    c = calculate_calories(75, 175, d, 2)
    cong = get_congratulation(d)
    print(get_stats(d, c, cong))

test_stats(10000)  # ~6.5 km
# Output: Today you walked 6.50 km and spent 349.38 kilocalories. Excellent result! Goal achieved.

test_stats(6000)  # ~3.9 km
# Output: Today you walked 3.90 km and spent 331.90 kilocalories. Not bad! The day was productive.

test_stats(3077)  # ~2.0 km
# Output: Today you walked 2.00 km and spent 321.74 kilocalories. Not enough, but we'll make up for it tomorrow!

test_stats(1000)  # ~0.65 km
# Output: Today you walked 0.65 km and spent 317.73 kilocalories. Lying down is also useful. The main thing is participation, not victory!
```

## Conclusion üöÄ
