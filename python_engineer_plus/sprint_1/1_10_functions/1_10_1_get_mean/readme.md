# get_mean Function Implementation

## Description üìù

The provided code implements the `get_mean` function, which calculates the arithmetic mean of a list of numbers (integers or floats) and returns the result rounded to two decimal places.

The function handles empty lists by returning `0.0`.

The code calls `get_mean` with the example list `num_lst = [3, 6, 5, 7, 9, 1]` and prints the result.

## Purpose üéØ

Intended for statistical calculations, data analysis, or educational examples of list operations, arithmetic mean computation, and rounding in Python.

## How It Works üîç

-   **Function Definition**:
    -   `get_mean` takes a list of numbers (`values: List[float | int]`).
    -   Returns a float (`float`), the arithmetic mean rounded to two decimal places.
    -   Uses type hints to indicate input can be integers or floats.
-   **Logic**:
    -   Checks if the list is empty (`if not values`):
        -   If empty, returns `0.0`.
    -   Computes the mean:
        -   `sum(values)`: Sums all numbers in the list.
        -   `len(values)`: Gets the count of numbers.
        -   `sum(values) / len(values)`: Calculates the arithmetic mean.
    -   Rounds the mean to two decimal places: `round(..., 2)`.
    -   Returns the result as a float.
-   **Main Code**:
    -   Defines `num_lst = [3, 6, 5, 7, 9, 1]`.
    -   Calls `get_mean(num_lst)` and prints the result.
-   **Behavior**:
    -   For `num_lst = [3, 6, 5, 7, 9, 1]`:
        -   Sum: `3 + 6 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 1 = 31`.
        -   Count: `6`.
        -   Mean: `31 / 6 = 5.166666...`.
        -   Rounded: `5.17`.
    -   Output: `5.17`.

## Verification ‚úÖ

Implementation satisfies requirements:

-   **Functionality**:
    -   Calculates the arithmetic mean of the input list.
    -   Rounds the result to two decimal places.
    -   Example: `[3, 6, 5, 7, 9, 1]`:
        -   Mean: `(3 + 6 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 1) / 6 = 31 / 6 = 5.166666...`.
        -   Rounded: `5.17`.
-   **Correctness**:
    -   `sum(values) / len(values)` computes the mean correctly.
    -   `round(..., 2)` ensures two decimal places.
    -   Empty list handling returns `0.0`, as specified.
    -   No validation needed, as inputs are guaranteed valid numbers.
-   **Output**:
    -   Prints: `5.17`.
-   **Documentation**: Clear docstring with type hints.

## Potential Considerations üõ†Ô∏è

-   **Correctness**:
    -   `sum(values)` handles both integers and floats correctly.
    -   Division by `len(values)` is safe, as empty lists are handled explicitly.
    -   Rounding to two decimal places matches the requirement.
    -   Type hint `List[float | int]` accurately reflects expected input.
-   **Performance**:
    -   `sum(values)`: O(n), where n is the list length (n=6 here).
    -   `len(values)`: O(1).
    -   Division and rounding: O(1).
    -   Total: O(n), efficient for typical list sizes.
-   **Design**:
    -   Type hints clarify input/output types.
    -   Simple logic is readable and maintainable.
    -   Empty list handling is explicit and clear.
-   **Alternatives**:
    -   Manual loop: `total = 0; for x in values: total += x` (more verbose).
    -   `statistics.mean`: Overkill for simple mean calculation.
    -   No rounding: Would not meet the two-decimal-place requirement.
-   **Extensibility**:
    -   Easily modified to handle different rounding precisions.
    -   Could add validation for non-numeric values if needed.
    -   Could return unrounded mean or handle other edge cases.
-   **Edge Cases**:
    -   Empty list: Returns `0.0`, as specified.
    -   Single element: `[5]` ‚Üí `5.00`.
    -   Large numbers: Handled by Python‚Äôs numeric precision.
    -   Floats: `[1.5, 2.5]` ‚Üí Correct mean (e.g., `2.00`).

## Usage Example (For Clarity, Not Submission) üì¶

```python
# Provided example
num_lst = [3, 6, 5, 7, 9, 1]
print(get_mean(num_lst))  # 5.17

# Additional test cases
print(get_mean([]))  # 0.0
print(get_mean([5]))  # 5.0
print(get_mean([1.5, 2.5]))  # 2.0
print(get_mean([10, 20, 30, 40]))  # 25.0
```

## Conclusion üöÄ

The `get_mean` function implementation is precise, correctly calculating the arithmetic mean of the input list `[3, 6, 5, 7, 9, 1]` as `5.17` (rounded to two decimal places) and handling empty lists by returning `0.0`.

It is concise, efficient, and fully compliant with the task‚Äôs requirements.

The implementation is ideal for statistical computations or teaching list operations and rounding, providing a clear and effective solution.
