# Price Difference Calculation for Butter and Margarine Products on June 10, 2019

## Description üìù

The provided SQL query calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum prices for each product in the 'butter and margarine' category (`–º–∞—Å–ª–æ —Å–ª–∏–≤–æ—á–Ω–æ–µ –∏ –º–∞—Ä–≥–∞—Ä–∏–Ω`) on June 10, 2019, from the `products_data_all` table.

It selects the product name (`name`) and the price difference (`max_min_diff`), converting the `price` to a floating-point number and the `date_upd` to a date format.

Results are grouped by product name to ensure unique products are analyzed. This query enables analysis of price variability for specific products on a given date in a retail database context.

## Purpose üéØ

Intended for assessing price fluctuations of 'butter and margarine' products on June 10, 2019, useful for pricing strategy analysis, market research, or educational exercises in SQL aggregation, type casting, and date handling within a retail environment.

## How It Works üîç

-   **Module Import**:

    -   No external modules; uses standard SQL syntax compatible with relational databases (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL).

-   **Query**:

    -   **`SELECT name, (MAX(CAST(price AS REAL)) - MIN(CAST(price AS REAL))) AS max_min_diff FROM products_data_all WHERE category = '–º–∞—Å–ª–æ —Å–ª–∏–≤–æ—á–Ω–æ–µ –∏ –º–∞—Ä–≥–∞—Ä–∏–Ω' AND CAST(date_upd AS DATE) = '2019-06-10' GROUP BY name;`**
        -   **Columns**:
            -   `name` (VARCHAR(255)): Product name from `products_data_all`.
            -   `(MAX(CAST(price AS REAL)) - MIN(CAST(price AS REAL))) AS max_min_diff`: Difference between maximum and minimum prices per product, with `price` (DECIMAL(10,2)) cast to floating-point (`REAL`).
        -   **Table**: `products_data_all`, containing product details (`id_product`, `name`, `category`, `units`, `weight`, `price`, `date_upd`, `id_store`, `name_store`).
        -   **Conditions**:
            -   `category = '–º–∞—Å–ª–æ —Å–ª–∏–≤–æ—á–Ω–æ–µ –∏ –º–∞—Ä–≥–∞—Ä–∏–Ω'`: Filters for 'butter and margarine' products (Cyrillic text).
            -   `CAST(date_upd AS DATE) = '2019-06-10'`: Converts `date_upd` (DATETIME) to date format and matches June 10, 2019.
        -   **Grouping**:
            -   `GROUP BY name`: Aggregates by product name to compute price differences for each unique product.
        -   **Returns**: One row per unique product name in the specified category and date, with the product name and price difference.

-   **Behavior**:
    -   Filters rows for 'butter and margarine' products on June 10, 2019.
    -   Groups by product name, calculating the max-min price difference.
    -   Based on the sample data:
        -   `products_data_all`: 20 rows, all with `category="–º–æ–ª–æ–∫–æ –∏ —Å–ª–∏–≤–∫–∏"`, `date_upd="2019-06-01 00:00:00"`.
        -   No rows match `category="–º–∞—Å–ª–æ —Å–ª–∏–≤–æ—á–Ω–æ–µ –∏ –º–∞—Ä–≥–∞—Ä–∏–Ω"` or `date_upd` on `2019-06-10`.
        -   Result: **No rows returned** due to no matching data.
    -   Expected output (if data existed):
        ```
        name | max_min_diff
        Butter Product A | 10.5
        Margarine Product B | 5.0
        ...
        ```
    -   **Row Count**: 0 rows with sample data.

## Verification ‚úÖ

Implementation satisfies requirements:

-   **Functionality**:

    -   Selects `name` and the difference between max and min prices (`max_min_diff`).
    -   Converts `price` to floating-point using `CAST(price AS REAL)`.
    -   Converts `date_upd` to date format using `CAST(date_upd AS DATE)`.
    -   Filters for 'butter and margarine' on June 10, 2019.
    -   Groups by `name`.

-   **Correctness**:

    -   `CAST(price AS REAL)` ensures floating-point arithmetic for `price` (DECIMAL(10,2)).
    -   `CAST(date_upd AS DATE)` correctly extracts the date portion of `date_upd` (DATETIME).
    -   `GROUP BY name` ensures price differences are calculated per unique product.
    -   Sample data has no matching rows (`category` or `date_upd`), so empty result is correct.
    -   Cyrillic `category` requires UTF-8 encoding.

-   **Output**:

    -   Matches required format: two columns (`name`, `max_min_diff`).
    -   Returns 0 rows with sample data, as expected.
    -   Column names and structure align with task requirements.

-   **Documentation**: Clear query structure and detailed README.

## Potential Considerations üõ†Ô∏è

-   **Correctness**:

    -   Assumes `products_data_all` exists; no error handling for missing tables.
    -   `category='–º–∞—Å–ª–æ —Å–ª–∏–≤–æ—á–Ω–æ–µ –∏ –º–∞—Ä–≥–∞—Ä–∏–Ω'` and `date_upd` filter yield no matches in sample data, indicating a possible data gap.
    -   `price` is non-`NULL` in sample data, ensuring valid `MAX` and `MIN` calculations.
    -   `CAST(date_upd AS DATE)` handles DATETIME format correctly (e.g., `2019-06-01 00:00:00` ‚Üí `2019-06-01`).

-   **Performance**:

    -   `MAX`, `MIN`, and `GROUP BY`: O(n) for n rows, efficient for small datasets (20 rows).
    -   Filtering on `category` and `date_upd` benefits from indexing, but none defined.
    -   Empty result minimizes data transfer.

-   **Design**:

    -   Focused query meets task requirements.
    -   `CAST(price AS REAL)` ensures floating-point output, though `DECIMAL` is precise.
    -   `GROUP BY name` is appropriate for unique products, as `id_product` may repeat across stores.

-   **Alternatives**:

    -   Use `CAST(price AS FLOAT)`: Equivalent to `REAL`.
    -   Round result: `ROUND(MAX(CAST(price AS REAL)) - MIN(CAST(price AS REAL)), 2)` for controlled decimals.
    -   Use `DATE(date_upd)`: Alternative date extraction in some databases.
    -   Add `ORDER BY max_min_diff DESC`: Sort by price difference for analysis.

-   **Extensibility**:

    -   Easily modify to include other categories or dates.
    -   Can extend with additional metrics (e.g., `COUNT(DISTINCT id_store)` per product).
    -   Supports integration into pricing reports or dashboards.

-   **Edge Cases**:
    -   **No Matching Rows**: Returns no rows (as with sample data).
    -   **Empty Table**: Returns no rows.
    -   **Missing Table**: Raises a database error (assumed handled by client).
    -   **Single Price**: `max_min_diff=0` if only one price exists for a product.
    -   **NULL Prices**: `MAX` and `MIN` ignore `NULL` (none in sample data).

## Usage Example (For Clarity, Not Submission) üì¶

```sql
-- Execute query
SELECT name, (MAX(CAST(price AS REAL)) - MIN(CAST(price AS REAL))) AS max_min_diff
FROM products_data_all
WHERE category = '–º–∞—Å–ª–æ —Å–ª–∏–≤–æ—á–Ω–æ–µ –∏ –º–∞—Ä–≥–∞—Ä–∏–Ω' AND CAST(date_upd AS DATE) = '2019-06-10'
GROUP BY name;
-- Output (based on sample data):
-- (empty result set)

-- Verify no matching data
SELECT name, price, date_upd, category
FROM products_data_all
WHERE category = '–º–∞—Å–ª–æ —Å–ª–∏–≤–æ—á–Ω–æ–µ –∏ –º–∞—Ä–≥–∞—Ä–∏–Ω' OR CAST(date_upd AS DATE) = '2019-06-10';
-- Output: (empty, as no rows match category or date)

-- Hypothetical example with matching data
-- Assume data:
-- id_product | name | category | price | date_upd | ...
-- 50 | Butter A | –º–∞—Å–ª–æ —Å–ª–∏–≤–æ—á–Ω–æ–µ –∏ –º–∞—Ä–≥–∞—Ä–∏–Ω | 100.00 | 2019-06-10 00:00:00 | ...
-- 50 | Butter A | –º–∞—Å–ª–æ —Å–ª–∏–≤–æ—á–Ω–æ–µ –∏ –º–∞—Ä–≥–∞—Ä–∏–Ω | 110.00 | 2019-06-10 00:00:00 | ...
-- 51 | Margarine B | –º–∞—Å–ª–æ —Å–ª–∏–≤–æ—á–Ω–æ–µ –∏ –º–∞—Ä–≥–∞—Ä–∏–Ω | 50.00 | 2019-06-10 00:00:00 | ...
SELECT name, (MAX(CAST(price AS REAL)) - MIN(CAST(price AS REAL))) AS max_min_diff
FROM products_data_all
WHERE category = '–º–∞—Å–ª–æ —Å–ª–∏–≤–æ—á–Ω–æ–µ –∏ –º–∞—Ä–≥–∞—Ä–∏–Ω' AND CAST(date_upd AS DATE) = '2019-06-10'
GROUP BY name;
-- Output:
-- name | max_min_diff
-- Butter A | 10.0
-- Margarine B | 0.0
```

## Example Scenario

Given `products_data_all` (sample, all non-matching):

```
id_product | name | category | units | weight | price | date_upd | id_store | name_store
3 | –ú–æ–ª–æ–∫–æ —Ü–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ –ø–∞—Å—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –í–∞—à–∞ –§–µ—Ä–º–∞ 3,4-6,0%, 1 –ª | –º–æ–ª–æ–∫–æ –∏ —Å–ª–∏–≤–∫–∏ | –ª | 1.000 | 69.00 | 2019-06-01 00:00:00 | 0 | –ú–æ–ª–æ—á–Ω—ã–µ –≤–∫—É—Å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏
5 | –ú–æ–ª–æ–∫–æ –ø–∞—Å—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –ò—Å–∫—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω–µ –í–∞—à –æ—Ç–±–æ—Ä–Ω–æ–µ 3,4-6,0%, 900 –º–ª | –º–æ–ª–æ–∫–æ –∏ —Å–ª–∏–≤–∫–∏ | –º–ª | NULL | 78.00 | 2019-06-01 00:00:00 | 0 | –ú–æ–ª–æ—á–Ω—ã–µ –≤–∫—É—Å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏
...
```

No rows match `category='–º–∞—Å–ª–æ —Å–ª–∏–≤–æ—á–Ω–æ–µ –∏ –º–∞—Ä–≥–∞—Ä–∏–Ω'` or `date_upd` on `2019-06-10`, so the query returns:

```
(empty result set)
```

## Conclusion üöÄ

The query successfully aims to calculate the difference between maximum and minimum prices for 'butter and margarine' products on June 10, 2019, naming the variable `max_min_diff` and converting `date_upd` to date format.

With the sample data, it returns no rows due to no matching category or date, which is correct given the data constraints.

The implementation is efficient, modular, and extensible, making it suitable for pricing analysis or teaching SQL aggregation, type casting, and date handling, provided relevant data exists.
