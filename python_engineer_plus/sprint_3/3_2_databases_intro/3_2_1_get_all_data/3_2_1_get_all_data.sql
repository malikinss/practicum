/*
You have access to a database. It contains many tables, but to complete the practical tasks you will need only four of them:

- `products`
- `products_data_all`
- `products_stores`
- `transactions`

First, look at how these tables are structured and what data they contain: for each table, write a query that will return all its columns.
